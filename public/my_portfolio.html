    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I am a web developer with a vast array of knowledge in many different
          fields that include both computer science and Legal. My background as
          a license Attorney in Florida and DC, includes understanding of copyrights
          and trademarks. As a Web Developer I have knowledge in both Front End and
          Back End languages, as well as, responsive frameworks, databases,
          API design and development. While studying at Wyncode Academy,
          I developed a solid foundation in data structures, algorithms, and system designs.
          My primary objective is to continue perfecting my craft, contribute to
          the technology sector, while I learn all that I can about web development.
